    <h2>What Is There to Do in Egypt Besides Visiting Ancient Monuments?</h2><br />
    <p>
        Located in the northeast corner of Africa and the southwest corner of Asia, Egypt connects the two continents through the Sinai Peninsula,
        which acts as a land bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ancient Greeks called Egypt the <strong>“Gift of the Nile”</strong> as it remained one of the region’s major food producers for thousands of years.
        The Nile River crosses Egypt’s desert plateau, flowing from the southernmost borders of the country all the way through the Delta to the Mediterranean.
    </p> <br />

    <p>
